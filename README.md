### Issue with Tailwind

This package was built with TailwindCSS, to demonstrate that it's possible to use any framework and have a final compiled javascript that can be used by Volet, even in an application that does not use TailwindCSS.

However, there is a known issue with TailwindCSS that makes some utilities not working properly when compiled into a Web Component.
